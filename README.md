# Relational Data Modeling
## Prerequisites
Configure a modelingcourse environment with Anaconda, an open source package management system.

1. Install miniconda on your machine following the instructions:
<br/>Linux: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html
<br/>Mac: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html
<br/>Windows: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html

2. Clone the github repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/team-data-science/relational-data-modeling.git
cd relational-data-modeling/assets_scripts
```

3. Running this command will create a new conda environment that is provisioned with most of the libraries you need for this project.

```
conda env create -f modelingenv.yml
```

4. Verify that the modelingcourse environment was created in your environments:

```
conda info --envs
```

5. Cleanup downloaded libraries (remove tarballs, zip files, etc):

```
conda clean -tp
```

6. To activate the environment:
<br/>OS X and Linux: ```$ source activate modelingcourse```
<br/>Windows:```$ source activate modelingcourse```
